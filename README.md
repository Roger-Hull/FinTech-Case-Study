# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

Mogo Financial Technology Inc, hereafter referred to as Mogo, was founded in 2003 by David Marshall Feller in Vancouver, British Columbia. The company offers a FinTech lending, credit, and other banking solutions to customers that are streamlined to save the customer time and money in comparison to traditional banks. Mogo has raised $263.8M USD through 8 financing rounds ranging from a venture round to an initial public stock offering.

## Business Activities:

Mogo Finance provides free credit score monitoring, identity fraud protection, prepaid credit cards that aim to protect the customer from incurring interest expenses while building credit, digital mortgage products, and other lending or credit products (Investopedia, 2022).

The company utilizes FinTech processes to streamline the process of attaining a banking product for its customers. For example, MogoMini is a mini loan product offered by Mogo that offers an approval, background check, and payment method that is completed entirely online. In contrast, traditional banks in Canada would require the customer to attend a meeting, sign paperwork, complete a credit check, and more (Mogo Financial, 2022).

The company's intended customer profiles are young, financially literate, and exploratory banking customers who seek a streamlined, cost-effective, and versatile banking solution. Customers of Mogo are likely to be age 20-40, have steady income, and are looking for ways to get ahead financially. Behaviours that are common to this customer would be engaging in personal finance activities such as budgeting and investing in the stock market. Customers would also be liekly to be familiar with the cryptocurrency market, blockchain, and NFTs. Finally, Mogo would also appeal to customers who see that traditional banks offer solutions that do not have the customer's best interests in mind.

To date, Mogo has 1.8 milion members who use Mogo's digital solutions to improve their finances (Mogo Financial, 2022). According to BDC, there are approximately 10 million millennials in Canada (BDC, 2022). With 10 million potential early majority cusotmers that Mogo could serve in Canada, and Mogo having a market cap of 200M CAD with 1.8 million customers, we can assume Mogo will have a total available market of $1,100M CAD (200M / 1.8M * 10M) without penetrating new customer profiles or entering new markets such as the United States of America.

Mogo's unfair advantage in Canada is the company's ability to provide interest free credit cards. For many financial institutions, credit card interest fees prodive the company with a large portion of it's annual revenue. For a financial instution to forgoe it's credit card interest fees would require the company to reduce its fixed staff costs and other expenditures. Because Mogo Financial has utilized automated FinTech systems and has followed a lean startup model, it has reduced its cost base enough to be able to provide interest free credit card products to its clients.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape:

Mogo Financial operates as a FinTech lending, payments, billing, wealth management, mortgage, and personal banking company (Bloomberg, 2022) https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-30/mogo-soars-24-after-saying-it-added-blockchain-capabilities. 

Within the mortgage market, Mogo acts as a mortgage broker as they help their cusotmers find the best mortgage offers through their mobile-friendly platform. FinTech solutions such as Mogo, plan on utilizing the data available to them to automatically fill out basic forms during the mortgage application process. Therefore, the solution can pull bank statements, income tax records, and personal information to generate a mortgage application in a much more streamlined way. This will also allow the financial instutuion to validate the income status of the individual and avoid mortgage fraud (Lendesk, 2022) https://www.lendesk.com/blog/fintech-changing-industry.


Mogo boasts utilizing a user-friendly chat bot experience that asks you simple questions to fill in a mortgage application if Mogo does not already have the information readily available. After filling out one application, Mogo will then provide the user with multiple mortgage options from multiple lenders ranging from fixed and variable mortgages that span over many ammortization periods. Once the user selects a mortgage from a financial institution, Mogo helps the user manage their mortgage payments and pay off their mortage sooner. Finally, the company offers the user Bitcoin cashback as a reward for choosing Mogo.

## Results

Mogo has been able to raise $263M USD, acquire 1.8 million customers, acquire four other FinTech companies (Fortification Capital, Moka, Carta Worldwide, and Difference Capital) and has been able to disrupt the Canadian Financial Industry significantly.

Because Mogo is looking to acquire new users and increase its own market share, the company is looking to offer the lowest cost product to its customer. Therefore, Mogo expects a customer who applies for a Mogo credit card to then use other Mogo lending, mortgage, trading, and cryptocurrency products. Therefore, unlike most financial instutions whose key performance metrics are profit per share, share price, and growth of their cusotmer base, Mogo is almost entire focused on it's acquisition of new users and developing marketing methodologies / products to help them acheive that goal.
